Vertical Slice was created for **Global Game Jam 2023**, with the goal of building a tiny but complete “slice” of a polished experience.

## My Role

- Implemented and tuned the core moment-to-moment gameplay flow  
- Helped shape the pacing and clarity of combat and interactions  
- Worked with the team to keep the scope small enough to ship in time  
- Focused on making the build feel like a polished slice, not just a prototype

## Highlights

- A complete, understandable gameplay loop built in only 48 hours  
- Strong feedback for first-time players: clear hits, reactions, and outcomes  
- Minimal bugs thanks to tight scope and constant playtesting  

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Finishing a complete slice**  
  We cut any feature that did not directly support the core loop, keeping the experience narrow but satisfying.

- **Maintaining clarity under time pressure**  
  Whenever something felt confusing, we simplified visuals, timing, or layout instead of adding complexity.

## Tech Stack

- Unity  
- 2D gameplay systems  
- Jam-ready architecture focused on speed and stability
