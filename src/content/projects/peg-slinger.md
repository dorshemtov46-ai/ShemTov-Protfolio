Peg Slinger is a prototype described in Dor Shem Tov’s portfolio, focusing on pachinko-style bouncing trajectories, board control, and satisfying chain reactions.

## My Role

- Designed the **core gameplay loop** and overall player experience  
- Defined the main win/fail conditions and the feedback around them  
- Adjusted balance and pacing based on internal playtests  
- Documented the design so it could be iterated on quickly

## Highlights

- Clear, readable structure that makes the main mechanic easy to grasp  
- Tight focus on a single strong idea instead of many half-finished systems  
- Built to support rapid iteration and experimentation

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Scoping the experience**  
  The design intentionally stayed small so the main idea could be polished instead of drowned in extra features.

- **Communicating feedback**  
  Visual and timing cues were added or simplified until players could quickly understand what worked and what didn’t.

## Tech Stack

- Unity and common modern game-design workflows (paper design, greybox, iteration)
