Devoured follows a lone explorer through a hostile alien ecosystem filled with shifting hazards,
predatory lifeforms, and limited safe zones. I contributed to level pacing, environmental storytelling,
hazard encounter design, and moment-to-moment tension balancing to maintain a creeping sense of danger
without overwhelming the player.
