Survive the Void blends cosmic fantasy with relentless action-survivor gameplay. Players
navigate dimensional rifts, upgrade abilities, and overcome escalating alien hordes.
I contributed to encounter pacing, area progression, enemy patterns, and readability-focused
FX direction during high-intensity moments.
